# Evergreen, Hercynia // 3.19.5014U

 In the morning, the squad went to the **GOVERNOR'S FARM** for their meeting with **PATIENCE** and **EDENA JI**.

 During this meeting **PATIENCE** described the situation surrounding the attacks on **EVERGREEN** Colonists. Attacks have been occuring for a little over a year; mostly in the **GRAY TOWNS** and against travelling convoys, but attacks against **EVERGREEN** itself is not uncommon, as evidence by the active sniper threat outside the settlement.

 Many militia members have been spreading stories that the attacks are being carried out by giant bugs. **EGREGORIANS**, giant, hexepedal, insect-like creatures that once inhabited **HERCYNIA**. **PATIENCE** dismisses these as scare tactics, and pulls up footage showing Human assailants using natural materials and chitinous covering to appear more insect-like in combat.

 **PATIENCE** also touches on the history of **HERCYNIA**, noting that **SECCOMM** had some sort of interaction with these **EGREGORIANS** while on the planet, but the population seems to have shrunk since those times.

 The squad is then provided two different urgent matters that could use their attention:

 - The sniper that is plaguing the colony needs to be taken care of, both for the safety of the colonists, as well as a potential lead of where these attacks are coming from.
 - **CHIEF ENGINEER CASTOR FIELDING** needs an armed escort to help bring supplies to **EVERGREEN'S** landing bowl so that the Engineering team can get to work repairing the sinkholes that have opened up. These repairs would allow larger ships to land at **EVERGREEN** and will help it's infrastructure and trade grow significantly.

 In the end, both of these missions are very important, and on an urgent timescale.

 The squad decides to help the Engineers, and **EDENA JI** shows them to the **PRINT SHOP** where they are able to begin printing their Mechs as well as meet **CASTOR FIELDING** and his Engineers.

 Piloting their newly-printed mechs, the squad escorts three **EVERGREEN COLONIAL ENGINEERING CORPS (CEC)** trucks full of supplies for the repair toward the landing bown, a few kilometers South of **EVERGREEN**.

 As they near the bowl, they start to see movment in the trees. Then, laser fire. They're under attack. The squad is forced to try to escort the trucks and engineers the rest of the way under duress.
