Johannes Bhraqma, born on the Earth-like colony of New Athens, was a child prodigy in athletics, showing exceptional talent in track and field events. His homeworld, known for its high gravity, contributed to his remarkable physical strength and endurance. By his late teens, Johannes had become a celebrated figure, not only on New Athens but across several star systems, for his Olympic achievements, especially in sprinting events.

His transition from an Olympian to a Lancer pilot was as dramatic as it was unexpected. During the closing ceremony of what was supposed to be his last Olympic event, New Athens was suddenly attacked by a rogue mercenary group. The attack devastated the main cities, including the Olympic stadium, leading to catastrophic losses.

Amidst the chaos, Johannes's natural instincts for survival and protection kicked in. He helped evacuate and save hundreds, showcasing not just his athletic prowess but also his innate leadership and tactical skills. This act of bravery didn't go unnoticed. An elite military group, impressed by his physical abilities and his quick, strategic thinking under pressure, offered him a chance to train as a Lancer pilot.

During his rigorous training, Johannes's athleticism was further honed for mechanized combat. His call sign, "Head Start," was a nod to his Olympic past and his uncanny ability to be always one step ahead of his enemies in the battlefield. As a Lancer pilot, Johannes specialized in reconnaissance and rapid strikes, using his agility and quick decision-making skills to outmaneuver opponents.

Haunted by the memories of the attack on his home and the loss of many friends and fellow athletes, Johannes now fights not just for his colony, but to prevent such tragedies from befalling others. His journey from an Olympic hero to a battle-hardened Lancer pilot makes him a unique and respected figure among his peers.
