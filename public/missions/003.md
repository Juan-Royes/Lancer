# Mission // #003
## Investigate Strange Signal

During mission 002, Nemi and Mozin both sensed a strange signal emanate after the jamming network was taken down. Nemi has identified remnants of the signal emanating from the gas giant, Granduer. In addition, an unidentified spacecraft is already heading to that location.

# Goals
- Find the source of the signal.
- Identify the other interested party.
- Exfiltrate before tidal forces close the eye of the storm on Granduer

# Stakes
- The mission is time critical. Act too slowly, and the eye of the storm will close and trap you on the planet's surface.
- Our understanding of the signal and the other party is basically zero. Keep your eyes peeled for anything out of the ordinary.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
